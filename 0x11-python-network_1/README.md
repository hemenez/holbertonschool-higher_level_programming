* All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* All files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.*)
* All files must be executalbe
* All modules should have documentation
* Code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)

## Environment
The project was tested and compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty64)` via Vagrant run through VirtualBox.

* The value of this variable is different for each request
* You don’t need to check script arguments (number and type)

### 6-post_email.py

* The email must be sent in the variable `email`
* Must only use the packages `requests` and `sys`
* You don’t need to error check arguments passed to the script (number or type)

Please test your script in the container provided, using the web server running on port 5000

### 7-error_code.py

Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the body of the response.

* The letter must be sent in the variable `q`
* If no argument is given, set `q=""`
* If the response body is properly JSON formatted and not empty, display the `id` and `name` like this: `[<id>] <name>`
* Otherwise:
  * Display `Not a valid JSON` if the JSON is invalid
  * Display `No result` if the JSON is empty
* Must only use the packages `requests` and `sys`

Please test your script in the container provided, using the web server running on port 5000. All JSON generated by this server are random.

### 9-starwars.py

Write a Python script that takes in a string and sends a search request to the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/documentation).

* Use the [Star Wars API search people endpoint](https://swapi.co/documentation#search)
